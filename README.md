# Zomato_DataAnalysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is a method of uncovering important relationships between the variables by using Graphs, plots, and tables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a very useful technique especially when you are working with the large unknown dataset.

## About Zomato
Zomato is an Indian restaurant search and discovery service founded in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah. It currently operates in 24 countries. It provides information and reviews of restaurants, including images of menus where the restaurant does not have its own website and also online delivery.

## The project
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places.
This Zomato data aims at analyzing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, etc for a particular location.

The csv file used for the analysis is zomato.csv

Libraries used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

In the project, analysis is done using graphs like countplot, and barplot.
